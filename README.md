This is again a small project which I am providing here for educational
purposes. The requirements are given in ERMS.pdf. It is implemented in API mode
using Flask and the front-end is created using AngularJS 1.7. Authentication is
token-based authentication.

To run the app, initialise the database thus:

    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade

Run the app with

    flask run

Good luck!
